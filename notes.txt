                    MY NOTES 
. when you are on website the data is transfered using http or htpps 
to get data .
. https is more secure 
. with https the client computer enscript the data when  the request 
is sent to the server and then when the server receives 
the request it decript it :) and then that its 
. http dont do that and theirfore a good to use https 
. some of the http methods include :
    GET
    POST
    PUT ->
    DELETE -> delete 
    UPDATE -> 
    PATCH -> partially update 
. these methods do as their name says 
. some of the things that http request have include 
version type 
url 
method 
request headers
body ( optional )
. after the http reqeust comes the http response which contain 
information that helps the browser display content 
. some of the content that a response contain include :
reqeusted resource 
content lenght 
content type 
headers 
etags 
time last modified 
http status codes 
            RESTFULESS 
an api(application programming interface ) is a gateway to the backend data 
an api is restfull if it complies with some things lets look at them:
clinet server artitechture ( server that seave the resources and client that consume them )
stateless( no prior info included about the clinet  )
should be cacheable ( response can be saved by any system   help reduce the server load )
layed ( system can be split into layes , add or remote layer at any time ,
layers of a restfull api could include the following :
firewall
load balancer
webserver 
database 
  )
uniform interface ( example unique URLs , unified procedures and more  )
optional code on demand ( api can produce business login 
code that can improve results 
 )

RESOURCES 
resources are core part of every rest api . for this lets take an example 
of little lemon which have a phone app which can be used by customers and managers ,
managers can use the app to get information about the orders and customers 
customers use the app to browse the menu and place orders 
. to do all of this the app use diffrent api to fetch data from the 
server and in each case the resource type will be diffrent , lets exprore 
some of the example 
RESOURCE TYPES 
if the manager want to see all of order he can call this 
API 1 : https://little.lemon/orders
. the resource type in this case is an order object 
lets take another example where the manager what to get a given order : 
API 2: https://little.lemon/orders/16
the resource type hereis order object 
API3: https://little.lemon/orders/16/custorm -> to see who placed the order 

the resource type in this case is an cusotmer object 
API 4: https://little.lemon/orders/16/menu-items
resource type in this case is menu-itmes object 
API 5 https://little.lemon/menu-items
resource type is menu item object 
https://little.lemon/menu-items?category=appetizers 
resource type here is menu item object 
note that the resource type is the same 
NAMING CONVENTION 

assuming that little lemon app need to create an api to display all 
the orders, a suitable name will be :
https://little.lemon/orders dont use capital O on orders 
so your api endpoint should always use lowercase letters and 
hyphens in between words 
using snake_case or TitleCase or camelCase is not a good practice 
. if your api require a user or a variable of any type use camel case 
for example an api for a specific order could be :
/orders/{orderId}

. your api should always use nouns and not verbs , this show 
poor desiqn of an api 
. also dont use http mehtods like delete as names of your api please 
DELETE -> /users/{userId}
PUT OR PATCH -> /orders/{orderId}
never use a file name extendion like .json in your naminng of the api 
if for example you want a json format you can do it this way 
/orders/{orderId}?format=json 
/orders/{orderId}?format=xml

for minified version of a javascript file 
/assets/js/jquery/3.6.0/min 
api names that end with a trainisng slash is a bad practice 


ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR API DEVELOPMENT 
. first is curl which is a command line utility used to make http calls 
this makes it easy to make it get request for other request you can do for examle post resquest 
curl -d "project-littlelemon" -x post 
https://postname-echo.com/post 
. the second tool is post man 
. the third tool is osommia which is used to store , organize and 
execute rest api reqeusts 
. also a text editor like visual studio or sublime text 
acknowledgmenst :
. insomnia , a product of kong ,is an open-source tool for tesing and 
debugging apis 
. httpbin is an open source http reqeust and response service created by 
kenneth reitz 


HOW TO CREATE A DJSNO PROJECT USING PIPENV 
first create a directory for your project and move to that 
directory , then install django with pipenv by running the follwing 
command :
pipenv install django 
after this you can activate your virtualenv by running the follwing command 
pipenv shell 
then you can create a project 
django-admin startproject <name> rest  you know 

REST API BEST PRACTICES

. the first one is kiss(keep it simple stupid)
what this mean is that each api should be for one task ,ie 
for every task develop an api 
. the second best practice is to provide a way to filter, order and paginate a reqeust
. another practice is to use versioning 
. caching by configuring headers (do more reseach )
. another is rate limiting and monitoring limiting limits the 
number of times a persion can call your api per minitues , hours or day , monitoring 
ensure that the clinet gets the best response from your api 
like stuatus code 

SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION IN REST API 

. the porpose of an api is to make your data more accessible 
not for your apps or website but for third parties 
. dont forget that since api are publically available they might 
pass a risk to your backend and theirfor security is paramount bro 
. first is ssl (secure socket layer ), ssl encript and secure  your data when it learves 
the browser or client  when you set it propery your website 
will be served using https instead of http which is not secure 
. another is signed urls where for example  little lemon 
wants their api to be accessed by only thier mobile app this is where 
signed urls comes to play( limited access to a resource for a limited time  )
to help this we use signature in our request and to help create this signature 
we use tool like HMAC=> do more research 
. another is authentication lets take an exmple where inorder to use 
an api you will be required to be authenticated , in this case you can 
be in every api call pass the password and username but this is not secure 
for that reason we use token based authentication over 
httb basic authentication 
.to do this you can use something like json web token (JWT)
. for authentication , 401 means unauthorized which means username and password dont match 
. 403 means forbidden ( you dont have permission to perform the action )
CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (cors policy and firewalls)
by configuring the cors header you can only accept calls from specific domain 
this is serverside login 
. another is firewalls which you can learn in linux course .

ACCESS CONTROL 

roles and priveleges are the key for access control 
role ( collection of privileges  )
privilege ( authority to do task )

lets create a crud booklist api project
... 
book = Book.objects.get(pk=16)
return jsonresponse(model_to_dict(book))
